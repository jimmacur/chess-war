## Technologies learned

This project marked my first experience working with VueJS, and I’ve grown to appreciate several aspects of the framework:

- Component Organization: Vue’s structure, with clear separation between templates, scripts, and styles, made development intuitive and efficient.
- State Management: Vue’s Composition API provided a powerful yet easy-to-use way to manage and share state across components.
- Component Communication: Using props and hooks for communication between components felt seamless and logical.
- Routing: Vue Router made navigation and dynamic routing simple and efficient.
